# Stripe Payment Integration

This repository demonstrates how to integrate Stripe payment functionality into a React Native application using Expo. It includes both backend and frontend components.

## Project Structure

```
stripe-client/
  App.tsx
  package.json
  tsconfig.json
  README.md
```

## Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- Expo CLI
- Stripe account with API keys

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the `stripe-client` directory:
   ```bash
   cd TestStripePayment-FE-App
   ```

### Backend

1. Start the backend server (not included in this repository).
2. Ensure the backend provides the following endpoints:
   - `/api/payment/get-publishable-key`: Returns the Stripe publishable key.
   - `/api/payment/create-payment-intent`: Creates a payment intent and returns the client secret.

### Frontend

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the Expo development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Run the app on your device or emulator:
   ```bash
   npm run android
   npm run ios
   npm run web
   ```

## Features

- Fetch Stripe publishable key from the backend.
- Create a payment intent with the backend.
- Initialize and present the Stripe Payment Sheet.

## Technologies Used

- React Native
- Expo
- Stripe React Native SDK
- Axios

## Notes

- Ensure the backend server is running and accessible before starting the app.
- The `.expo` folder is automatically generated by Expo and should not be committed to version control.
